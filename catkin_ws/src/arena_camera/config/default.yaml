######################## Image Intensity Settings ########################
##########################################################################
# The following settings do *NOT* have to be set. Each camera has default
# values which provide an automatic image adjustment resulting in valid
# images
##########################################################################
#  The exposure time in microseconds to be set after opening the camera.
# exposure: 10000.0
#  The target gain in percent of the maximal value the camera supports
#  For USB-Cameras, the gain is in dB, for GigE-Cameras it is given in so
#  called 'device specific units'.
#gain: 1.0
#  Gamma correction of pixel intensity.
#  Adjusts the brightness of the pixel values output by the camera's sensor
#  to account for a non-linearity in the human perception of brightness or
#  of the display system (such as CRT).
gamma: 0.5
#  The average intensity value of the images. It depends the exposure time
#  as well as the gain setting. If 'exposure' is provided, the interface will
#  try to reach the desired brightness by only varying the gain. (What may
#  often fail, because the range of possible exposure vaules is many
#  times higher than the gain range). If 'gain' is provided, the interface will
#  try to reach the desired brightness by only varying the exposure time. If
#  gain AND exposure are given, it is not possible to reach the brightness,
#  because both are assumed to be fix.
brightness: 20 #(min:0 max:255)
#  Only relevant, if 'brightness' is set:
#  The brightness_continuous flag controls the auto brightness function.
#  If it is set to false, the brightness will only be reached once.
#  Hence changing light conditions lead to changing brightness values.
#  If it is set to true, the given brightness will be reached continuously,
#  trying to adapt to changing light conditions. This is only possible for
#  values in the possible auto range of the arena API which is e.g. [50 - 205]
#  for acA2500-14um and acA1920-40gm
# brightness_continuous: true
#  Only relevant, if 'brightness' is set:
#  If the camera should try to reach and / or keep the brightness, hence
#  adapting to changing light conditions, at least one of the following flags
#  must be set.
#  If both are set, the interface will use the profile that tries to keep the
#  gain at minimum to reduce white noise.
#  The exposure_auto flag indicates, that the desired brightness will be
#  reached by adapting the exposure time.
#  The gain_auto flag indicates, that the desired brightness will be
#  reached by adapting the gain.
exposure_auto: true
gain_auto: true
##########################################################################
#  The timeout while searching the exposure which is connected to the
#  desired brightness. For slow system this has to be increased.
# exposure_search_timeout: 5.0
#  The exposure search can be limited with an upper bound. This is to prevent
#  very high exposure times and resulting timeouts.
#  A typical value for this upper bound is ~2000000us.
# auto_exposure_upper_limit: 2000000.0
#  The MTU size. Only used for GigE cameras.
#  To prevent lost frames configure the camera has to be configured
#  with the MTU size the network card supports. A value greater 3000
#  should be good (1500 for RaspberryPI)
# gige:
#  mtu_size: 3000
#  Only used for GigE cameras.
#  The inter-package delay in ticks to prevent lost frames.
#  For most of GigE-Cameras, a value of 1000 is reasonable.
#  For cameras used on a RaspberryPI this value should be set to 11772.
# gige:
#  inter_pkg_delay: 1000
